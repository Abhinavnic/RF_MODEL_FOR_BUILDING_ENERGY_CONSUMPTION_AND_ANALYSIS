## __1. Overview:__
This project focuses on using Random Forest (RF) to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings. By leveraging historical energy usage data, the model predicts future consumption patterns, identifies key influencing factors, and detects anomalies, ultimately improving energy efficiency.

The study aims to:

- Develop a Random Forest-based predictive model for energy consumption forecasting.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score, and Accuracy.
- Provide insights that assist in HVAC optimization, demand-side management, and anomaly detection.
## __2. Implemented Algorithm: Random Forest (RF):__
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is particularly useful in smart building energy management because:

- Robustness: Handles complex, non-linear relationships between energy consumption factors. 
- Feature Importance: Identifies which parameters (e.g., temperature, occupancy) impact energy usage the most.
- Reduction of Overfitting: Uses bootstrap aggregation (bagging) to enhance generalization.
- Handles Missing Data: Works well even when some sensor data is incomplete.
### Model Characteristics:
- Ensemble of Decision Trees: Improves stability and accuracy over a single decision tree.
- Random Feature Selection: Enhances model diversity and reduces bias.
- Low Computational Cost: Faster than deep learning models while maintaining high accuracy.
## __3. Dataset Used:__
The dataset consists of 3,840 records of energy consumption data, including:

- Time-based variables (hour, day, season).
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
- Building-specific data (occupancy, HVAC usage).
